/**
 * Single source of truth for the reference app's network configuration: the API base URL and every
 * endpoint path/URL the app talks to.
 *
 * Screens and screen configs (see `App.kt`, `AuthNavigation.kt`) should reference these constants
 * instead of hardcoding paths, so there is exactly one place to update when the backend contract
 * changes.
 *
 * [BASE_AUTH_URL] is intentionally not a literal in this file - it is not committed to source at
 * all. It is read from `local.properties` (`apiBaseUrl`) or the `API_BASE_URL` environment variable
 * by the `:icl-client-reference-app` Gradle build, which generates [LocalConfig]. See the repo
 * README ("Configure the API base URL") for setup instructions.
